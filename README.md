# chatterbox-client
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## About
The purpose of this sprint was to understand how API calls from servers can properly be called and displayed on the front-end for the client to see. Once that was accomplished, we had to flesh out the front end so we can have a nice, visually appealing instant chat service with rooms and user IDs.
